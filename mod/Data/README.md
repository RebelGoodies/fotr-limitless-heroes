## Description

Do you want more republic hero slots? Do you want complete control of your hero roster?
This submod removes restrictions on the amount of heroes allowed for the player.

### Changes

- As the republic player, you may assign as many or as few heroes as you deem necessary.
  The choice is yours.
  Note that just because you *can* recruit every hero doesn't mean you have to.
  Some hero options are still locked by prerequisites or for story purposes.
  Note: The Republic AI will not recruit any extra heroes by itself!
  Rather, the AI only gains another hero if they take a planet from the the player.

- 30+ historical locked heroes have been added to the Republic command staff, and more.
  Most are in a new category for senators with up to 15 senators available.

- New CIS hero categories have been added: Space Leaders, Ground Leaders, and Sith.
  These work the same as the Republic hero system, and can be used to assign and retire heroes.
  Includes 20+ historical locked heroes as CIS staff options.

- Unite Mandalore: Both of the Mandalorian clans can be supported by any faction.
  Get Mandalore to 8 influence and choose one or both clans.
  CIS AI picks only the Protectors.
  Hutts AI picks only Death Watch.
  Republic AI picks nothing.

- All Bounty hunters, mercenaries, and pirates can be hired by the CIS and Hutts.
  Each bounty hunter or mercenary is given to whoever buys them first.
  The entire pirate roster can be purchased in full by both factions.
  AI seems to purchase heroes very sparingly.

- Special structures that generate minor commanders will do so in about half the time from before (fastest is 5 cycles, slowest is 22).

- Miscellaneous (non exhaustive):
  - If Sate Pestage is in orbit, you may swap Pestage for Mon Mothma and vice versa.
  - Join or split Anakin and Obi-Wan/Ahsoka to and from the Twilight ship if both are in orbit.
  - Lorz Geptun available for the CIS at era 2, or for the Republic on era 3+ starts.
  - Ghost Company (Waxer & Boil) can be built when Cody is in orbit.
  - Domino Squad can be built at Kamino or Rishi Moon in era 2.
